# Brain_Tumor

Hello Everyone! My name is Krish Chauhan and this is my Lab Groups and my Research Work! I used a simple CNN Model for my cross examination of the project whereas my partners used a CNN VGG16 and a Artifical Neural Network, better known as ANN Model, for their cross examination. At the End of this project, we will test and visually see the results for ourselves on which model performs best using a image classification dataset.
